    <h1>Echoes of Resilience: Odes to Women</h1>
    <img src="task1.jpg" alt="Leila's Story" width="300" height="400">
    <p>"In the tapestry of life, women weave their grace,<br>
        Threads of resilience, in every embrace.<br>
        Like rivers that carve through mountains so tall,<br>
        They shape the landscape, they conquer it all.</p>
    <p>With hearts like oceans, vast and deep,<br>
        They navigate storms, their secrets they keep.<br>
        Rooted in history, like ancient trees,<br>
        Yet reaching for stars, with boundless dreams.</p>
    <p>In the dance of existence, their steps leave a mark,<br>
        Guiding the lost, through the shadows so dark.<br>
        They're the fire that ignites, in the depths of the night,<br>
        A beacon of hope, a guiding light.</p>
    <p>For in every woman, a universe resides,<br>
        Where dreams take flight, and courage abides.<br>
        They're the poetry of life, in every verse,<br>
        A testament to strength, in blessings and curse."</p>
